# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

This starting code for this app was provied by [London App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/) in their Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp course on LinkedIn Learning. 

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what I learnt in the Dicee tutorial. This challenge required me to build an 8 ball app and applying what I learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I created

I created a magical 8 ball app, which will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
